# Tools for Compression

## 1. oggenc
oggenc and the libogg and libvorbis libraries implement a command-line encoding tool for Ogg Vorbis.
Ogg Vorbis is a non-proprietary lossy audio compression scheme (broadly similar to the well known MP3 format). 
This is based on the 1.0.1 distribution of vorbis-tools. 
oggenc.c source code (1.7MB). 
As a freely-redistributable test input, 
I suggest a WAV file containing the speech that John F. Kennedy gave in Berlin in June 1963: 
JFK Berlin speech WAV (bzip2 compressed, 28MB).
