# Video 360 Project Introduction

In this project, we use Kafka w/ Zookeeper for stream video processing. 

## Demo Setup

In this Kafka cluster, we have four roles:
- producers 
- consumers
- stream processors
- connectors 


We use Linux Server as connectors to DBs, while using AndriodOS as producers and consumers.

In the first stage of this demo, we will not take stream processors (i.e. data aggregation, registeration and rasterization).\
However, in later releases, we will add this part in.
